### ✅ Original Code

```python
print(Notes from Day 1")
 print("The print statement is used to output strings")
print("Strings are strings of characters"
priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")
```


### ✅ Corrected Code

```python
print("Notes from Day 1")
print("The print statement is used to output strings")
print("Strings are strings of characters")
print("String concatenation is done with the + sign")
print("New lines can be created with a \\ and the letter n")
```

### ❌ What Was Wrong (and the Fix)

**1. Missing opening quote**

```python
print(Notes from Day 1")
```

✔ Fixed by adding the opening quotation mark:

```python
print("Notes from Day 1")
```

---

**2. Incorrect indentation**

```python
 print("The print statement is used to output strings")
```

✔ Removed unnecessary leading space to avoid indentation issues.

---

**3. Missing closing quote**

```python
print("Strings are strings of characters"
```

✔ Added the closing quotation mark and parenthesis.

---

**4. Typo in function name**

```python
priint("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
```

✔ Corrected `priint` → `print`.

---

**5. Incorrect escape character usage**

```python
print(("New lines can be created with a \ and the letter n")
```

✔ Escaped the backslash properly:

```python
print("New lines can be created with a \\ and the letter n")
```
