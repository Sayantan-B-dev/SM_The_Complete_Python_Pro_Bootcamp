Things to note: you can either **build coding as a habit** by practicing **1 hour every day** for long-term consistency, or you can choose **deep-focus sessions**, where you code for longer stretches on fewer days and immerse yourself fully in problem-solving.

Both approaches work. Daily coding helps reinforce muscle memory, syntax familiarity, and logical thinking. Longer sessions help you understand architecture, debug complex issues, and complete projects end to end. The key is not the schedule itself, but **showing up regularly and writing real code**.

Pick the style that fits your lifestyle, stay consistent with it, and avoid long gaps. Progress in programming comes from repetition, reflection, and gradually increasing the difficulty of what you build.
