**Setup Guide – Getting Started with Python and PyCharm**

**Step 1: Install Python**
Download and install Python from the official website:
[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

During installation, make sure to:

* Tick **“Add Python to PATH / Environment Variables”** if you are using the standalone installer.
* Choose **Custom Installation** so you can enable optional components like **tcl/tk**, which will be required later in the course.

Notes:

* On Windows, Python can also be installed directly from the **Microsoft Store** (uses the Install Manager, PATH is handled automatically).
* On Linux, you may need to manually install `python3-tk` using your package manager.

**Step 2: Install PyCharm**
Download PyCharm using the official link (Unified version).

Important points:

* The **Community Edition is discontinued**. There is now a single unified version.
* You may see a trial for Pro/AI features, but the **core version remains free**.
* If PyCharm is already installed, **update to the latest version** to avoid compatibility issues with course content.
