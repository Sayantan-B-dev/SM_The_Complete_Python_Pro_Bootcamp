### Tips So Far — Python Fundamentals Phase

Build habits, not bursts. Short, regular coding sessions beat long, irregular ones. Even 30–60 minutes a day compounds quickly when you’re consistent.

Understand before optimizing. Write the clear version first, then refactor. Clean logic matters more than clever shortcuts at this stage.

Treat errors as teachers. Read the full traceback. Identify whether it’s a **TypeError**, **ValueError**, or logic mistake, and fix the root cause instead of patching symptoms.

Be explicit with types. Remember `input()` is always a string. Convert deliberately, validate early, and don’t assume Python will “guess” what you mean.

Prefer readability. Use meaningful variable names, `snake_case`, consistent indentation, and f-strings. Code is read more than it’s written.

Print with purpose. Use `print()` to inspect values and flow while learning, then remove unnecessary prints once the logic is stable.

Master operators and precedence. Parentheses clarify intent. Assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.) make updates concise and reduce bugs.

Refactor small projects. Rebuild the Band Name Generator, Tip Calculator, or BMI Calculator cleaner each time. Repetition with improvement is real learning.

Validate user input. Assume it can be wrong. Use checks or `try-except` in anything interactive.

Keep a learning log. Note what you learned, what broke, and what to revisit. Tight feedback loops accelerate progress.

These fundamentals—types, strings, operators, input, and formatting—are the backbone. Get them solid, and everything that follows becomes easier.
